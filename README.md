  Amazon-clone (Frontend code)

🚀An Amazon clone built entirely with HTML and CSS! 🛒💻

🔍 Inspired by the user-friendly interface and seamless shopping experience of Amazon, I set out to recreate some of its core features using front-end technologies.

🎨 Leveraging HTML for structuring and CSS for styling, I meticulously crafted each component to mirror the familiar look and feel of Amazon's website.
